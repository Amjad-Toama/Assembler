Assembler: Robust error handling, detailed reporting, and user-friendly. Convert your code effortlessly.

Repository Name: Assembler Project - Error-Resilient Assembly Code Converter

Description:
This Git repository houses an assembler project designed to convert assembly code with a '.as' extension into three distinct output files: object code, entry, and extern. Developed with an emphasis on robustness and error recovery, this assembler ensures that assembly code is thoroughly scrutinized to identify and report various types of errors, providing clear and informative feedback to the user.

Key Features:

1. **Assembly Code Input**: Users are required to supply their assembly code with a '.as' extension. This code serves as the input for the assembler.

2. **Error Recovery**: The assembler is equipped with advanced error recovery mechanisms. It comprehensively checks the entire assembly code for errors, ensuring that even in the presence of issues like syntax errors, undefined variables, and undefined instructions, it continues processing and reports all encountered errors.

3. **Error Reporting**: The assembler provides detailed error reports to assist users in debugging their assembly code effectively. These reports include information about the type of error, the location in the code where the error occurred, and suggestions for resolution.

4. **Output Generation**:
   - **Object Code**: The assembler generates object code, a binary representation of the assembly code, which can be executed on the target architecture.
   - **Entry File**: An entry file is created to identify code entry points, making it easier to execute the program.
   - **Extern File**: An extern file is generated to track external references, helping with linking and resolving dependencies.

5. **User-Friendly Interface**: The assembler is designed to be user-friendly, offering a straightforward way to process assembly code and receive error feedback. 

6. **Compatibility**: The assembler supports a wide range of assembly code syntaxes and is easily adaptable to various assembly languages.

Whether you are a seasoned assembly programmer or a beginner, this assembler project aims to streamline the process of converting assembly code while prioritizing error detection and providing comprehensive error reports to aid in code refinement. Feel free to contribute, report issues, or use this tool to enhance your assembly programming experience.
